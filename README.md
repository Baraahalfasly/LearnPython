# LearnPython

1- My first python code (hello world)

This is my second code python. 

a= [10]
E = 0
O = 0
for i in a:
    if i % 2 == 0:
       E += 1 
    else:
       O += 1
print("Number of even numbers: ",E)
print("Number of odd numbers: ", O)

"This code counts the even and odd numbers in list a. If an element is even, the variable E is incremented by 1, and if it is odd, the variable O is incremented by 1. At the end, it prints the count of even and odd numbers"
